# Introduction
While I was preparing articles for [Javascript Fundamentals](/blog/javascript-fundamentals-what-is-javascript) series, I realized that there are just too many Javascript syntax that it feels a little off to include them in the blog. Blog was for step by step guides, not a wikipedia of sort. So I'm writing different Javascript methods and properties here instead!
