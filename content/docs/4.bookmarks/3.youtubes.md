# Youtube Channels For Development
There are many online resources where I learnt about web development; youtubes, blogs, Udemy courses and more. Youtube is probably the most accessible of them all. I'll list of some youtube channels that I found useful and share more if I happen to discover something intersting!

### Net Ninja

He has lots of video series that covers many frontend web frameworks. If you are just getting started in any of the framework, the chances are, Net Ninja already has video series on that. His videos are great for you to get started and experiment with new framework that you are interested in! 

### TechWorld with Nana

With my recent interest on DevOps, I started watching her youtube videos and I'm actually impressed by the quality of her videos. She explained the DevOps concepts crystal clear (clearer than one of the Udemy Course that I took) and shows the practical examples of how DevOps work. If you are curious about DevOps but never had the chance to understand what it's about, I recommend watching her videos!

### Web Dev Simplified

I usually watch his videos when I want to explore any interesting tools/syntax/framework on web development in general. It helped me to discover many intriguing ES6 syntax, CSS that I never knew existed before and helped solidifying some of React concepts. For some reason, my impression of him is mostly covering snippets of latest tools on web development, but he has several in depth guide videos as well!

### Tony Alicea

He is probably most renowned for his [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) video. I liked how he talked about deeper aspects of vanilla Javascript and it intigued me enough to study Javascript more in depth (that's when I started reading [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS))
