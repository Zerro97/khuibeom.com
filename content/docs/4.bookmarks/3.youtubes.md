# Youtube Channels For Development
There are many online resources where I learnt about web development; youtubes, blogs, Udemy courses and more. Youtube is probably the most accessible of them all. Below are some of youtube channels that I found useful:

### Net Ninja

He has lots of video series that cover various frontend web frameworks. If you are just getting started in any of the framework, I really recommend Net Ninja, not only because he has wide range of web tutorials to follow, but also because his explanations are really easy to understand. I usually start with Net ninja's video to experiment with new framework that I'm interested in.

### TechWorld with Nana

She mostly deal with DevOps and I'm actually impressed by the quality of her videos. Her explanation on DevOps concepts are crystal clear (clearer than one of the Udemy Course that I took) and the practical examples she gives are invaluable. If you are curious about DevOps but never had the chance to understand what it's about, I recommend watching her videos!

### Web Dev Simplified

I usually watch his videos when I want to explore any interesting tools/syntax/framework on web development in general. He helped me to discover many intriguing ES6 syntax, CSS that I never knew existed before and helped solidifying some of React concepts. While his videos are helpful in discovering latest tools on web development, he has several in depth guide videos as well!

### Tony Alicea

He is probably most renowned for his [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) video. I liked how he talked about deeper aspects of vanilla Javascript and it intigued me enough to study Javascript more in depth.
