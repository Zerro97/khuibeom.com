# Bloggers to Follow
Below are the list of bloggers that I think are both helpful and inspring:

### Tania Rascia
- [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/)

She was the first blogger that I started following when I got into web development. Her articles are really on point and relevant.

### Anthony Fu
- [antfu.me](https://antfu.me/)

He is creator of Vitest, Slidev, VueUse, UnoCSS and more. Just look at his [repo](https://github.com/antfu). His works inspire me a lot as a developer. His articles are really interesting to read too.


### Theodorus Clarence
- [theodorusclarence.com](https://theodorusclarence.com/)

Another inspiration for me. He started learning web development two years ago and yet his articles are so clear and applicable

### Swyx
- [swyx.io](https://www.swyx.io/)

I first got to know about him through [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) article that he wrote. He writes a lot of good posts and share some of his insights as a developer
