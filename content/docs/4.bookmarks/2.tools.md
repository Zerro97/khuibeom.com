# List of Online Tools
There are quite number of useful tools online. I thought it would be helpful to share them here:

1. [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/): 100+ icon sets with more than 100,000 icons from [iconify](https://github.com/iconify/iconify)
2. [metaseo.itsvg.in](https://metaseo.itsvg.in/): Preview and create meta data for you. Super helpful for SEO
3. [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/): Draw diagrams online.
4. [type-scale.com](https://type-scale.com/): Generate sensible font sizes for different headings
5. [read-o-meter](https://niram.org/read/): Calculate how long it will take to read an article. I use this for my posts.
6. [haikei](https://app.haikei.app/): Generate blob, wave, poly grid and more in SVG format. Could be useful for web design.
7. [shadows.brumm.af](https://shadows.brumm.af/): Preview & generate box shadow
8. [gradient designer](https://gradient-designer.csspost.com/): Preview & generate color gradient
9. [layoutit](https://grid.layoutit.com/): Design a layout using grid css
10. [coolers](https://coolors.co/): Generate color pallettes
11. [xml-sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/): Generate sitemap.xml for your site


### Misc
1. [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat): This was too interesting not to include in here. Developed by openAI, it can answer questions in human like fashion. Apparently stackexchange [banned it](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned) after people were using chatGPT to answer questions posted on stackexchange. 
2. [asciiflow](https://asciiflow.com/#/): Can be used to design ascii art. I never knew people actually use online tools to generate text art.
