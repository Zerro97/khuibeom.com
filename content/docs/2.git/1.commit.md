# Introduction 
Leaving a meaningful commit can be useful for when:

1. working with group of people 
2. you want to refresh your memories in future

Recently, I started using conventional commit coupled with tools such as [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) and [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli). Conventional commit allows for auto generation of changelog through tools like [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) in github action

## Conventional Commit
In commitizen, they offer following commit types to choose from:

| Type | Description |
|--------|---------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests|
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) |
| `ci` | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

Here's the format:

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

Here's some example:
- `feat(navbar): changed color of navbar`
- `docs: added contributor list to README`
- `chore(deps) Update all non-major dependencies`

Still, I wasn't entirely sure when to use which commit type and scope. For now, I'm looking at other open source projects and learning from their examples.
