# Big O Notation
To measure the performance of the code, we use something called Big O notation. It is used for determining time and space complexity of the code. We have 4 rules when it comes to determining Big O Notation:

1. **Always use the worst case:** Even if best case results in `O(1)`, if the worst case is `O(n)`, the algorithm is still at `O(n)`.
2. **Drop the constants:** If we have `O(1/2n + 1)`, we drop the constants and turn it into `O(n)`
3. **Drop the non dominant:** If we have `O(n! + n^2 + 99n)`, big O is `O(n!)`
4. **Different terms for different inputs:** If we have 2 different inputs passed as an argument to the function, we use 2 different terms to represent their complexity (ie. `O(m)` and `O(n)`). So if we have 2 loops that depends on each input, we would have `O(m + n)` instead of `O(2n)`.
