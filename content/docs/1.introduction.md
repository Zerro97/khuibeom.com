# Introduction

I have created this documentation page in order to record and document my daily learnings. 

First inspired by [documentation](https://docs.thcl.dev/) written by [Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com/), I thought having a personal documentation page sounded nice. Keeping documentation section will be similar to how I make notes in my personal notebook, this time I will be organizing my learnings in public! 

I was inspired by an [article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) written by swyx. People learn from each other. [Learning in public](https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549) motivates people to keep learning and discover things that they did not know before. There are a lot of amazing people out there in internet and by looking at their work, people learn things that they did not know before. I realized that contributing to open source projects can force me to think about how the open source author approached certain problems. This means that I am actually trying to understand how people like [anthony fu](https://github.com/antfu) code which seemed really distant for me before. One thing about being out in public is that, it makes me feel accountable and this actually motivates me to learn new things.

My second reason to creating this documentation page is that, I wanted to write things that are more progressive in nature. As compared to the blog articles, wiki is something that could accumulate over time. Even though I might not know certain knowledge at one time, I could learn about it in future and come back to this documentation to record it down. Since documentation is more partitioned than blog articles, it will allow me to write wide variety of things.

Last but not least, I feel that making wiki allows more freedom than coming up with blog post to write about. Thinking back at when I first created a blog in 2020, I realized that writing blogs require a lot of conscious effort. This actually prevented me from posting an article because I always felt that my posts were not perfect and posting half-assed articles felt weird. I'm hoping by creating a documentation section in my blog, I can record my learnings more often and write without feeling too pressured by it.
