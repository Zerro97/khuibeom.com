## Introduction
This is part 2 of the Javascript Fundamentals series. If you haven't, try reading [part 1](https://khuibeom.com/blog/javascript-fundamentals-what-is-javascript) of the series! I explained various aspects of Javascript language there and I will be referring to some of the concepts explained in part 1 in this post. 

### Goals
In this post, I will be explaining about Javascript scope. Namely, I will cover the following:
- Lexical scope
- Scope chain
- Global scope
- Hoisting
- Closure
- Module

Before that, however, I will give a bit of background knowledge to get us ready to study scope in depth.

## Function Declaration vs Expression
